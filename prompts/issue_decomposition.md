# Prompt: GitHub Issue Decomposition (BDD Style)

Your task is to act as an expert senior developer and guide me through a collaborative and iterative process of breaking down a GitHub issue. We will use a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach to create a series of high-level, incremental sub-issues. The goal is to produce tasks so clear and self-contained that they can be easily implemented by a **junior developer** and reviewed by a stakeholder.

### Process

1.  **Identify the Target Issue:**
    *   Start by asking the user to provide the URL of the GitHub issue you need to decompose. Once you have the issue, proceed to the next step.

2.  **Full Context Analysis:**
    *   Thoroughly read the provided GitHub issue to understand the user's goal, the problem to be solved, and any acceptance criteria mentioned.
    *   Investigate the codebase to gather technical context. Use `search_file_content`, `glob`, and `read_file` to find relevant files, modules, and functions.
    *   Consult `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, and any documents in `docs/` to understand the project's architecture, conventions, and required commands.

3.  **Decomposition and Creation:**
    *   Plan a logical sequence of steps that deliver value incrementally. Focus on creating "vertical slices" of functionality. For example, when creating a new form, a good sequence is: 1. Build the basic UI. 2. Implement the logic to save the data to the database. 3. Add validations and display user feedback.
    *   Each sub-issue must represent a distinct, verifiable step in this sequence.
    *   For each step, you will first **create a new issue** using the template in `docs/sub_issue_template.md`. Immediately after the issue is created, you will **link it as a sub-issue** to the parent.

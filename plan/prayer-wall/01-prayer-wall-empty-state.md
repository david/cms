# Task: Initial Setup - Prayer Wall Empty State

This task involved setting up the basic infrastructure for the prayer wall.

*   A new LiveView (`PrayerLive.Index`) was created to serve as the main interface.
*   A route (`/prayers`) was added to the application's router.
*   An initial "empty state" was implemented to handle cases where no prayer requests exist yet, providing a user-friendly message and a call to action.
*   Basic tests were added to verify the empty state's appearance.

*Corresponds to commit `2c659d65b7cf`.*
